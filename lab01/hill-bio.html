    Outside of school, I manage a Nonprofit Organization, <strong>Women of Chiapas</strong>, to spread the stories of the women in Chiapas, Mexico, with them and by them, for a greater recognition of their cultural rights as Mayan women. Aside from Women of Chiapas, I enjoy baking desserts and creating new recipes! I also like to stay active and spend quality time with friends and family. Overall, I am just an empathetic, kind-hearted girl from Los Angeles, California.
